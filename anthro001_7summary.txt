Science is a way of understanding the natural world that relies on only observation of nature. It presupposes that everything in the natural world and all natural phenomena have constant cause-effect relationships and can be understood with naturalistic explanations. Presently, science is the dominant way of understanding the natural world in our society. This way of understanding is a recent development, because for the majority of human history, causes of natural phenomena were assumed to be supernatural in origin. In contrast, science completely avoids supernatural explanations for events in the natural world.

The type and quality of scientific investigation that can be done at any particular point in time is constrained by the limitations of the society in which the investigations are being done. This includes the limitations of available technology, laws, societal acceptance etc.  Similarly, how the information that science produces is used is completely up to society and individual humans. 

The scientific method can roughly be described as accurately recording observations, using data from those observations to create hypotheses, testing those hypotheses with experiments, and relating the strong conclusions form those experiments to an existing body of scientific information. All conclusions that are reached through the scientific method are temporary because the conclusions of today will be replaces with newer, better, conclusions based on the best data available, when when that data becomes available. Science is self correcting in this way; conclusions are repeatedly put to the test with controlled repeatable experiments.
