Pat Shipman argues that our survival beyond the extinction of Neanderthals is due to our invasiveness as a species and our partnership with and domestication of dogs. Despite having the survival advantage due to familiarity with the terrain they occupied in across Europe, Neanderthals went extinct approximately 39,000 years ago according the current best dating techniques. Previous leading hypotheses for this extinction included inability of the Neanderthals to adapt to the severe climate fluctuations, and violent encounters with humans. Pat Shipman has rejected these hypotheses due to insufficient or contradictory data. Newer and more accurate carbon dating disproves the climate hypothesis and provides no data in support of the violent encounter hypothesis. She believes that the Neanderthals extinction was due to effects on the ecosystem caused by our superior hunting strategies. In particular, our domestication of dogs allowed us to use longer range weapons, set up longer term camps, track prey better, and better protect ourselves and our kills. There is some fossil evidence to support this hypothesis, namely that all known per-historic wolf-dog fossils are found at sites created by humans.

The hypothesis that Neanderthals died out because humans out-consumed the resources that the Neanderthals were competing for is plausible. It seems likely that an invasive species (humans) managed to domesticate pre-historic wolves/dogs, use them as a hunting tool and push their competitors (Neanderthals) out from the food chain, leading to the extinction of their competitors. So far the fossil evidence seems to support this position as well.
